# Consensus

Working Groups, Steering Committee and all Working Group Projects in the Foundation operate under a consensus model. This means there needs to be agreement on every decision made. 

## How do I disagree with a decision?

You should clearly state this by using the words “I object” either verbally or in writing. 

## How are disagreements resolved?

Where the Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the decision will be made by a Supermajority Vote (in which 66% of members need to agree).
