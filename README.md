# Higher Education Engagement

Higher Education Engagement is a project to meet educators and learners where they are to become and educate Green Software practitioners by supporting them with content and engagement that is a holistic engagement with the Green Software Foundation.

This project is run through the [Community Working Group](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/community-wg) in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).

## Scope
The primary audience for this project is the education audience of educators and learners. We will be using a needs assessment approach to make sure we are building an offering of various services (e.g., curriculum, expertise mentors, research support) that are desired by higher learning institutions. There are a variety of ways that higher education learning institutions get access to sustainability content, but we will provide a cafeteria plan of offerings that focus on Green Software (and not “Big S” sustainability).

Currently it is difficult to find authoritative information on Green Software, not to be confused with larger sustainability topics which can focus more around building data centers, using natural energy solutions, etc. Also, the needs of learners and educators is very different than perhaps passionate sustainability enthusiasts or certain industries. Also, there is great demand for providing scalable content for Green Software to educational institutions who has a variety of ways of interacting with content. 

With this project, we will be able to provide a holistic offering that is based on the needs of education institutions. It will also be focused on Green Software practitioners to guide them from awareness to education to practical application.
